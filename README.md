 ### Simple Neural Network Model
A simple neural network model consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains nodes, also known as neurons, which perform mathematical operations on the input data to produce the output. Through a process called backpropagation, the network adjusts its weights to minimize the difference between its predicted output and the actual output, thus learning to make accurate predictions.

### L1 Regularization
L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty to the neural network's loss function based on the absolute values of the weights. This penalty encourages the model to reduce the less important weights to zero, effectively performing feature selection and making the model simpler.

### L2 Regularization
L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty to the neural network's loss function based on the squared values of the weights. This penalty discourages large weight values, preventing overfitting and improving the generalization of the model.

### Elastic Net Regularization
Elastic Net regularization combines both L1 and L2 regularization by adding both the absolute and squared values of the weights to the loss function. This hybrid approach allows the model to benefit from the feature selection capability of L1 regularization while also benefiting from the stability and generalization improvements provided by L2 regularization.
